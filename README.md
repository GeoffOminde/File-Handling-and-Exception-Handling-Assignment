##  File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️ + Error Handling Lab 🧪

## 📌 Overview
This project combines two essential Python skills:  
1. **File I/O (Input/Output)** — reading from and writing to files.  
2. **Error Handling** — gracefully managing unexpected issues like missing files or permission errors.

By completing this challenge, you'll learn how to build **robust, fault-tolerant programs** that can handle real-world file operations without crashing.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Read** the contents of a file.
- **Modify** the data in some way (e.g., transform text, filter lines, add formatting).
- **Write** the modified content to a new file.
- **Prompt** the user for a filename at runtime.
- **Handle errors** if:
  - The file doesn’t exist.
  - The file can’t be read due to permissions or other issues.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- **Interactive filename input** from the user.
- **Customizable modification logic** for file content.
- **Error messages** that are clear and user-friendly.
- **Safe file writing** to avoid overwriting important data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- A text file to test with (e.g., `sample.txt`)

### 2️⃣ Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-read-write-challenge.git
cd file-read-write-challenge
```
### 3️⃣ Usage
Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```
When prompted, enter the filename you want to read. If the file exists and is readable, the program will:

1.Read its contents.

2.Apply modifications.

3.Save the result to a new file.

## ⚠️ Error Handling
The program uses Python’s try / except blocks to:

- Detect missing files (FileNotFoundError).

- Catch permission issues (PermissionError).

- Handle unexpected errors gracefully.

Example:

```text
Enter the filename to read: missing.txt
Error: The file 'missing.txt' was not found. Please check the name and try again.
```
## 🧠 Learning Outcomes 🎉
By the end of this module, you will:

- Confidently read and write files in Python.

- Implement exception handling for safer programs.

- Understand how to interact with users for file-based tasks.

- Be able to build resilient applications that don’t crash on common errors.

## 💡 Ideas for Extension
- Add logging to track file operations.

- Allow batch processing of multiple files.

- Implement different modification modes (uppercase, lowercase, word count, etc.).

- Add unit tests for file operations.
